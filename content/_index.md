# Good, better, Copenhagen 
Every other should bike to school or work, better bicycling parking facilities at stations, 30-40km additional tracks and lanes and more. Such are some of the initiatives stated in the initiative *Good, Better, Best - The City of Copenhagen’s Bicycle Strategy 2011-2025* introduced by the city council of Copenhagen in *2011*. Created as a part of making Copenhagen a carbon neutral city in the year of *2025*. With *2025* coming closer we take a deep dive into see just how the initiave have influence the copenhagernes bicyckling habbits, if one can spot changes looking at a 11-year period from *2009* to *2018*, and if vehicles still dominate the roads across Copenhagen.
Finally we take a *hard* look on external factors, such as weather and temperature in order to anaylse and perhabs predict influences corralated with up's and down's in the habits of taking the car or bike.
