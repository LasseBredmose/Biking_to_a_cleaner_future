# Good, better, Copenhagen 
With more than 350 km of bicycling tracks, and the initaite from the city of Copenhagen "good, better, best – The City of Copenhagen's Bicycle Strategy 2011–2025" how does Copenhagen fair in todays world? 

Copenhagen, a frontier for bicycling and an inspiration for the rest of the world(*except Amsterdam*). Everyday more than 1.2 million kilometres are cycled in Copenhagen. More than half of the population in Copenhagen, prefer to bike to work or school [ref](https://web.archive.org/web/20190707123514/https://www.kk.dk/indhold/62-af-koebenhavnerne-cykler-til-arbejde-og-uddannelse).

To conduct our analysis, we need some data. Thus the data used is a preprocessed [traffic data set from OpenData](https://www.opendata.dk/city-of-copenhagen/trafiktal), originally from the Copenhagen Municipality. The data has further been combined with the original raw dataset to gain further information and limited to a 10-year period of 2009 to 2018. The data is obtained by people (our so-called *counters*) who have stood at various locations in Copenhagen to count the number of passing bikes or cars. Most of the *counters* have been placed in central Copenhagen, Vesterbro and Nørrebro, along with some of the main roads. There are even a few *counters* in Frederiksberg, although not being within the municipality and no *counters* in Nordhavn.

## Inspection throughout years

**Skal vi opfordre læseren til at bruge de interaktive visualiseringer?**

Firstly, let us look at the entire time period and the levels for bikes and cars for each year. The number of observations for our two modes of transport is steady throughout all years, although a drop is seen for the year of 2017. It might be tempting to jump the conclusion that there must have been less bikes and less cars within this year, but it is important to keep in mind that we are dealing with count data!

Copenhagen, a frontier for bicycling and an inspiration for the rest of the world(except Amsterdam). A beacon for the future in these trying times, where battling climate changes and fossil fuels is reduced to an everyday problem that most of us are tired of hearing on repeat. 
But does Copenhagen live up to such glorius rumors or is it still a city dominated by cars, despite the persistent efforts from the elected officials. 
This and more will be researched and highlighted
