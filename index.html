Such are some of the goals stated in the initiative <em>Good, Better, Best - The City of Copenhagen’s Bicycle Strategy 2011-2025</em> introduced by the city council of Copenhagen in 2011. This was created as a part of making Copenhagen a carbon neutral city in the year of 2025 [1]. With 2025 coming closer, we take a deep dive to investigate just how the initiaves have influenced the copenhagernes' bicycling habits. We will look into whether changes at a 10-year period from 2009 to 2018 can be spotted, and if vehicles still dominate the roads across Copenhagen. Finally we include weather conditions to analyze their influences on our daily transportation patterns.</p><h1 id=data>Data</h1><div><iframe src=./html/map_points.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=60% height=425 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=0 align=left style=margin-right:.5em;margin-top:.4em;margin-bottom:1em></iframe></div><p>To conduct our analysis, we need some data. Thus the data used is a preprocessed <a href=https://www.opendata.dk/city-of-copenhagen/trafiktal><em>traffic dataset from OpenData</em></a>, originally collected by the Copenhagen Municipality. The data has further been combined with the original raw dataset to gain further information and limited to a 10-year period of 2009 to 2018. The data is obtained by people (our so-called <em>counters</em>) who have stood at various locations in Copenhagen to count the number of passing bikes and cars. Most of the <em>counters</em> have been placed in central Copenhagen, Vesterbro and Nørrebro, along with some of the main roads. This can be seen on the map to the left, for which the reader is encouraged to explore. There are even a few <em>counters</em> in Frederiksberg, although the district not being within the municipality, but no <em>counters</em> in Nordhavn.</p><h2 id=inspection-throughout-years>Inspection throughout years</h2><p>Firstly, let us look at the entire time period and the levels for bikes and cars for each year. The number of observations for our two modes of transport is steady throughout the years, although a drop is seen for the year of 2017. It might be tempting to jump the conclusion that there must have been less bikes and less cars within this year, but it is important to keep in mind that we are dealing with count data! So there could be other reasons for this dip. Let us inspect whether this is the case by <strong>hovering</strong> over the bars in the visualization.</p><iframe src=./html/num_obs_by_year.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=100% align=center height=420 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=1></iframe>
We see that the fraction of bikes and cars stays somewhat constant for all years, but there are less counters for the year of 2017, which could have caused the drop. We would expect that the fewer counters we have, the less observations there will be. However, by further inspection, the number of counters might not be the entire reason for this phenomenon. The drop in counters from 2014 to 2015, for example, is 60 - the exact same as the drop in counters from 2015 to 2017. However, the gap in the number of observations is much larger from 2015 to 2017, than between 2014 and 2015. Therefore, we could imagine that other factors could also have contributed to the drop.<h2 id=inspection-throughout-months>Inspection throughout months</h2><p>Nextly, we can take a look at the monthly time period, accumulated throughout all years. In a provided <em>counting guide</em> , we observe that the frequent counting months are May, June, August, September, and October [2]. Looking at the data, we observe a relatively high amount of observations in April. By <strong>hovering</strong> over the bar, we are informed that the month of April is one of the months with most counters, despite not being featured as an official month from the guide. Unfortunately, we can only speculate on why this is the case. However, as they do special countings ordered by external entities, such as the <em>University of Aarhus</em> or <em>Vejdirektoratet</em>, more pressing matters might have forced them to count outside the regular schedule.</p><iframe src=./html/num_obs_by_month.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=100% height=420 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=1></iframe>
In August, we notice a small amount of counters along with a small amount of observations, which also diverges from the guide, stating that August is an active counting month. However, a deeper look into the guide tells us that August, along with June, are active months for counting pedestrians. Thus, it can be a reason why we see observations for these months, as some counters might have included bikes and cars in their countings.<h1 id=daily-patterns>Daily patterns</h1><p>It is difficult to obtain sufficient information of patterns throughout the years and months. Instead, let us look at the development in activity from 7 to 19. For both bikes and cars, the peaks are in the morning and afternoon, which fits with when most people need to go to work, school or other daily obligations and return home. For gaining a simple overview, it is also possible to only look at cars or bikes, by <strong>toggling</strong> either cars or bikes off in the plot.</p><iframe src=./html/num_obs_by_hour.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=100% height=420 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=1></iframe><p>It is worth noticing that there is a difference in the ratios between bikes and cars in the morning. From 7 to 8, the gap between the amount of cars and bikes is larger than from 9 to 10. This could be explained by how people with cars tend to have a longer commute e.g. having to get out of the city, or dropping off kids, thus having to leave their home earlier. With a car, traffic also plays a larger factor than with bikes. It would thus not be entirely surprising if there is a need for getting up earlier to avoid running into that.</p><h2 id=spatial-patterns>Spatial patterns</h2><p>Knowing the daily development in activity in the entire city, a question arises about whether the same trend is seen across each counting spot. And if not, it would be interesting to inspect exactly which places that encounter a lot of changes in activity through the day.</p><h3 id=bikes>Bikes</h3><p>We start by investigating the changes in activity for the bikes. In the video below, it is shown that there is constant activity around central Copenhagen throughout the entire day. Central Copenhagen, or <em>Indre by</em> is where we find many shopping opportunities, tourist attractions and workplaces. It is thus not surprising that this part will incur a lot of buzz with biking being a mode of transportation that makes it easy to get around to various attractions, cafés etc., even outside of rush hour.</p><p>By <strong>playing</strong> the video, it can be seen that during rush hour, both in the morning and late afternoon, the activity has more of a spread, no longer being as concentrated around the center. The spread is e.g. towards <em>Nørrebro</em>. This would be due to how people get to and off work and would have to ride their bikes throughout the various districts outside center.</p><iframe src=./html/map_time_bike.html id=left_frame sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=95% height=500 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=0 style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em></iframe><p>The reader is encouraged to use the <strong>hover tool</strong> to discover the aggregated total amount of bikes in Copenhagen. From here, we see that <em>Indre By</em> is the district with by far the most bikes throughout the entire time period also, fitting with how the activity level is always high here.</p><h3 id=cars>Cars</h3><p>For cars, it is a bit of a different story, although similar in some areas. <em>Indre By</em> remains the district that constantly has high levels of activity, but interestingly, there is a larger spread of cars throughout various other districts than with bikes. This is especially seen during the morning and afternoon, which follows closely with how people with cars would have longer commutes and thus having to pass the outer districts too.</p><iframe src=./html/map_time_cars.html id=right_frame sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=95% height=500 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=0 style=margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em></iframe><p>By <strong>zooming in on the map</strong>, it is seen that there is a clear impact on many of the main roads leading into and out of <em>Indre By</em> such as <em>Ågade</em>, <em>Åboulevard</em>, <em>Nørre Allé</em> and <em>Tuborgvej</em>. Also, high activity points can be found for roads leading out of the city, e.g. <em>Frederikssundsvej</em>, <em>Jyllingevej</em>, <em>Roskildevej</em>, <em>Hareskovvej</em> and <em>Strandvejen</em>, indicating that people with cars would have longer commutes. Thus riding a bike might not be a straight forward option, especially when considering the additional travel time and the unpredictable weather in Copenhagen.</p><h1 id=impact-of-the-weather>Impact of the weather</h1><div><iframe src=./html/map_weather.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=50% height=500 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=0 align=right style=margin-right:.5em;margin-top:.4em;margin-bottom:1em></iframe></div><p>&mldr;And now to the weather.<br>As mentioned earlier we have accuried data of the specific weather for <strong>each??</strong> of the days when the counting took place. The data is measured using three different weather stations, where each of them can measure precipitation, wind and/or temperature. The specific measure equipment for each of the weather stations can be seen, by <strong>clicking</strong> on each of the markers. In order to work further with the data, we have taken an average for the days where multiple weather stations have collected the same measurement-type.</p><p>In the figure/graphs? below we can see the measurements for the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. <strong>Note that the figures/graphs are only a subset of the data, as it can be hard to notice trends when observing the whole period.</strong><br><br></p><p>Each data point is added as a circle on the graph, thus one can see which periods we have datapoints for. Luckly these are the same periods for which we have traffic observations.
For the temperature we observe that it almost always stays positive while frequently getting above 15 degrees celcius. Looking at both the temperature and precipitation, where there are very few days with high precipitation, implies most of the counting has taken part on sunny days. The wind speed does not seem to have a impact in the selection of days, where the counters have been out, as it fluctuate between 2 and 8 frequently. The reader is incurred to <strong>click and drag</strong> to explore weather data for the whole period.</p><iframe src=./html/temp_wind_precip_development.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=100% height=640 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=1 style=margin-bottom:1em></iframe>
<iframe src=./html/temp_wind_precip_bikescars.html sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" width=100% height=380 scrolling=no seamless frameborder=1></iframe><p>Considering the temperature, we see a trend for the average amount of bikes. As expected, the higher the temperature, the more bikes are seen in the streets. This trend, however, drops for temperatures higher than 20 degrees. Looking at the average amount of cars, we see (almost) the opposite trend. The average amount of cars decrease as the temperature increase - again, until the temperature is higher than 20 degrees. Such relationship can be questioned as it might be caused by lack of data in the summer period where the temperature is usually at its highest.</p><p>In regard to the wind speed, we notice a larger average amount of bikes being counted when the wind speed is less than 2 m/s. From this, it drops and becomes more steady throughout the remaining wind speed intervals. Thus, it seems like However, it is noticed that when the wind speed is high, there are in average also more cars in the streets of Copenhagen.
Precipitation: Unfortunetely, the traffic data did (almost) not include days with precipitation. Thus, the above plot does not include much information about the patterns in bikes or cars for days with precipitation.</p><h1 id=machine-learning>Machine Learning</h1><p>mldkjhfng
